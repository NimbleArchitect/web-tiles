# web-tiles
Displays 3 or 4 tiles in a single windows with each tile being a seperate web browser page

I wrote this for personal use to display two seperate slack groups along with outlook and teams web pages in the same window that con be maximised on a Mac, this allows me to see all notification windows without having to switch between apps

the src folder contains the code,
the macos folder is just an app wrapper around the same code that is in the src folder

this is not production ready code, use at your own risk

you will need python3 qt6, pyqt and possibly others
